# Privacy Policy — Vimmich

*Last updated: February 2026*

Vimmich is a photo viewing client for self-hosted [Immich](https://immich.app) servers, developed by Julian Gray. This policy explains how the app handles your data.

---

## Data We Collect

**We collect no data.** The app contains no analytics, crash reporting, advertising, or user tracking of any kind.

---

## Your Photos and Server Connection

Vimmich connects exclusively to the Immich server URL you provide. Your photos and videos are fetched directly from your own server and are never transmitted to us or any third party. All network communication is between your Apple Vision Pro and your personal server.

How your data is stored and managed on the Immich server itself is governed by the [Immich Privacy Policy](https://immich.app/privacy-policy). If you are running a self-hosted instance, you are responsible for the data on your own server.

---

## Local Storage

The app stores the following data locally on your device:

- **Thumbnails and previews** — cached temporarily to improve performance
- **Offline media** — photos and videos you explicitly choose to save for offline viewing
- **Server URL** — stored in device preferences so you don't need to re-enter it
- **Access token** — stored securely in the device Keychain

None of this data is shared with anyone.

---

## Authentication

Your login credentials (server URL, email, and password) are used solely to authenticate with your Immich server. The resulting access token is stored in the device Keychain using standard iOS/visionOS security. Your password is never stored.

---

## Third-Party Services

The app uses no third-party SDKs, frameworks, analytics services, or advertising networks. All functionality is built using Apple's standard system frameworks.

---

## Children's Privacy

The app does not collect data from anyone, including children under 13.

---

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted at this URL with a revised date.
